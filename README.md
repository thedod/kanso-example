Kanso boilerplate
-----------------

Just trying to continue beyond the last step of kanso's [getting started](http://kan.so/docs/Third-party_modules) and make a simple app that has a view, a show, and a list. Also uses the [bootstrap package](http://kan.so/packages/details/bootstrap) (nothing fancy. Mainly shows that the less compiler works).

To upload the sample data, run `./upload-data.sh http://localhost:5984/example`

Hope it's useful
