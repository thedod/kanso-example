### Changes from master branch

This branch also uses the [dust](http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/) template engine.

Instead of a static index.html, we use the `templates/homepage.html` template,
although effectively it's a static page (no `{...}` fields).

`lib/rewrites.js` maps `/` to `_list/homepage/empty`,
where `empty` is a dummy view (defined at `lib/views.js`) that returns nothing.
